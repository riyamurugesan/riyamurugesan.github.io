        I'm from Matthews, North Carolina and am currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill, graduating in May 2028. I’m pursuing a double major in Biology and Computer Science to learn how to develop interdisciplinary solutions that utilize technology to address critical healthcare issues.
        <br>
        <br>
        Last year, under the guidance of Dr. John Vavalle in UNC’s Heart Valve Clinic, I used Excel to determine if there was a relationship between prosthetic valve size and blood leak after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for 215 patients post-procedure. During my time in the clinic, I watched 20+ procedures, from TAVRs and catheterizations to ablations in the electrophysiology lab. After witnessing how integral computer models and imaging are for proper navigation during procedures – whether it be mapping electrical currents during ablation or maneuvering a catheter to the aortic valve, I was drawn to how computers can be used to optimize clinical outcomes.

        My passion for medicine heightened after witnessing my close friend’s mother pass away from a heart attack – an event that gave a new meaning to the research I was conducting in UNC’s Heart Valve Clinic. Despite witnessing multiple procedures that reduce the risk for myocardial infarctions, I saw firsthand that these interventions sometimes arrive too late, after a patient's underlying risk factors have caused serious harm. This realization, combined with my interest in biology, inspired me to analyze the body’s internal mechanisms to better understand and mitigate patient risk. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, I am a member in both the Bautch Lab and Cardiovascular Modeling and Simulation laboratory, where I support research that uses biological and computational approaches to analyze blood flow and valve anatomy and their effect on cell behavior and valvular pressures, respectively. In the future, I hope to develop models to refine pre-procedural planning and reduce patient’s risk for thrombosis.
